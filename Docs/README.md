## React Typescript Italanta Assessment Authored By Azhar Ahmed Sheikh Takoy

This project is aimed at duplicating the following Elewa websites using react ts framework;
 1. https://elewa.ke/social-impact

For my assessment I was only able to design this single webpage as I ran out of time.

To start the Application you'll run the following commands;

 ```bash
npm install 
npm run dev
```
Then Open another terminal to start the json server;

```bash
 json-server --watch db.json
```

If you don't have the JSON, Install it using the following commands in Ubuntu or MacOs;

```bash
sudo npm install -g json-server
```
